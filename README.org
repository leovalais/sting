#+TITLE: =sting= --- A testing library for Common Lisp

* Installation
Clone this repository where ASDF (or Quicklisp, cf. https://www.quicklisp.org/)
can find it (for example under =~/common-lisp=).

Optionally, to enable interaction with Emacs:
- Open the directory =sting/emacs= within Emacs (using Dired)
- Run =M-x= =package-install-from-buffer=
- Then, put in your Emacs configuration file:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'sting)
(setq sly-enable-evaluate-in-emacs t) ; if you're using Sly
(setq slime-enable-evaluate-in-emacs t) ; if you're using Slime
  #+END_SRC
- And in your Common Lisp configuration file (for example =~/.sbclrc=):
  #+BEGIN_SRC common-lisp
(pushnew *features* :sting-with-emacs)
  #+END_SRC
